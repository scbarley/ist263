    <h3>Creative Process</h3>
    <p>So I've been writing songs for a couple of years now, since highschool really. But I never really got it, not until this past year. But it took me a really long time to get a rithym going.</p>

    <p>So my song creation process is pretty simple. I have a couple different techniques for writing. One avenue I take is finding beats, whether that is on youtube, or any of my people send me them, and then I'll write rhymes based off the beat. Another way that it happens is I just get inspired and the only way I can understand them is if I write them down. I turn these words into rhymes and then I try to find a beat or a certain bpm and work off from there. Only recently I had learned about hooks, bridges, and bar structure. So basically a bar is when you rhyme the last word on the fourth beat, that entire sentence is one bar. <br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little <u>star</u> <br>
        How I wonder what you <u>are</u> <br>
        Up above a world so <u>high</u> <br>
        Like a diamond in the <u>sky</u> <br>
    Each underlined word Is the end of one bar. Another way of thinking of a bar is 4 beats. This song snippet is 4 bars. A standard (although there really is no standard) verse is anywhere from 8, 16, 32, even 64 bars. Some songs are longer, but a 16-bar verse is a pretty good length. You have enough time to say something of substance but they're not too long where it's a problem. I try to write as many 16 bar verses as I can, just to improve my rhyme schemes. I usually try to get 4 bars in a row that rhyme with the same ending sound, and then somehow do that three more times and get a 16. But most full length, 3 minute plus songs, need over 32 bars with a hook and bridge. A hook is just a catchy phrase, or couple of phrases, that repeats at least once in the song. A bridge fills in a gap in time in a song, and its usually a place where the beat builds up to a chorus or does the opposite and connects it to the next verse. But again, there's no right way to do it, it's just the mold that is out there.
